As I have end the mathematical model class,
I found it's a problem to collect students' homework.
So I want to make a tool to deal with it.

What it should be are as follow:
#read the student list which save as excl file
#create the task to receive the homework
#connect to email to receive student homework.
#repliad the email when receive email, the content
depend on the received email format.
#update the receive task and conpose the receive list
