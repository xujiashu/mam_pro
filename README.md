As I have end the mathematical model class,

I found it's a problem to collect students' homework.

So I want to make a tool to deal with it.

What it should be are as follow:

#read the student list which save as excl file.

#create the task to receive the homework.

#connect to email to receive student homework.(fail to login for safty problem)

#return the result of homework collection.(test fail)

#update the receive task and conpose the receive list.

在我完成我的数学建模选修课后，

我发现收集课程期末作业很麻烦。

所以我想写一个工具来帮我自动处理收作业的问题。

设想的功能：

#从excel表格读取学生名单

#建立收取任务

#连接到邮箱收取电子版作业,登陆失败（安全问题）

#根据收取作业的文件格式正确与否返回收取结果（测试不通过）

#更新收取任务，返回已收取和未收取作业学生的名单
